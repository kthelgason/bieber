# Bieber
A command-line app for reference-tracking written in node.

It's very barebones at the moment but I plan to add features as I need them.

The design is influenced by git, in that Bieber creates a `.bieber` file in the root
of your project directory. The file is really a sqlite database that stores your references.

#features
  * add urls to projects with a description
  * output BibTeX
  * not much else :)
